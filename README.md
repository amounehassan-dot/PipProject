Picture-in-Picture (PiP)


Picture-in-Picture, also known as PiP, is a feature that allows a video to continue playing in a small
floating window while the user uses other apps. PiP is a multitasking tool that helps people stay productive while still watching content.
This makes it possible to multitask, for example:
- Watch a video while texting
- Follow instructions while browsing the internet
- Keep a video call open while checking another app


What My Project Does

This project is an iOS app that demonstrates how PiP works on iPhone and iPad.
The app:
- Plays a video inside the app
- Allows the user to tap a button to enter Picture-in-Picture
- Lets the video continue playing even after leaving the app
- Supports play, pause, and stop controls
- Automatically enters PiP when the app goes to the background


Why PiP Is Useful

- Multitasking
- Keeps content running even when switching apps
- Great for tutorials and learning
- Works during video calls


How PiP Works 

1. The video starts inside the app.
2. When the user activates PiP, the system (iOS) turns the video into a small floating window.
3. The app is no longer responsible for the video — the system controls it.
4. The video stays on top of all apps until the user closes it or returns to the app.


What’s Inside the App

- A video player
- Play, pause, and stop buttons
- A PiP button
- An audio setup so the video continues in background
- A video file named PiratesVideo.mp4


How to Use the App

1. Open the app
2. The video will appear and begin playing
3. Tap PiP to enter Picture-in-Picture mode
4. Leave the app — the video keeps playing in a floating window
5. Tap the window to return to full screen
6. Use play/pause/stop controls anytime
